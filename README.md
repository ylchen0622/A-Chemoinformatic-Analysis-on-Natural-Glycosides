## A Chemoinformatic Analysis on Natural Glycosides with Respect to Biological Origin and Structural Class

<h4> &emsp;&emsp; In the current study, we provide a highlight on the occurrence of nature glycosides, especially the varied distribution in different biological sources and the structural types of glycosides. The results are obtained by chemoinformatic analysis of the Dictionary of Natural Products, which contains 264,071 records (CRC Press, v25.1). These findings could help us to interpret the preference of NPsâ€™ glycosylation and to investigate how NP glycosylation could aid NP-based drug discovery.</h4>
<h4> &emsp;&emsp; We plan to publish this research in Nat. Prod. Rep. </h4>
<h4> &emsp;&emsp; Of particular note, the original dataset (DNP) used in this study was distributed commercially and we cannot share it online. Processed data are available to the academic community upon request.</h4>
