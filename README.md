## A Chemoinformatic Analysis on Natural Glycosides with Respect to Biological Origin and Structural Class

### &emsp;&emsp; In the current study, we provide a highlight on the occurrence of nature glycosides, especially the varied distribution in different biological sources and structural types of glycosides. The results are obtained by chemoinformatic analysis of the Dictionary of Natural Products, which contains 264,071 records (CRC Press, v25.1). These findings could help us to interpret the preference of NPs’ glycosylation and to investigate how NP glycosylation could aid NP-based drug discovery.
