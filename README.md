<h2> A Chemoinformatic Analysis on Natural Glycosides with Respect to Biological Origin and Structural Class </h2>
<h2> As one of the most important NPs’ structural modifications, glycosylation can change the NPs’ polarity, and then alter their solubility, making the aglycones more amphipathic. However, till now, little is known about the general distribution profile of the natural glycosides in different biological sources or structural types. In the current study, we provide a highlight on the occurrence of nature glycosides, especially the varied distribution in different biological sources and the structural types of glycosides. The results are obtained by chemoinformatic analysis of the Dictionary of Natural Products, which contains 264,071 records (CRC Press, v25.1). These findings could help us to interpret the preference of NPs’ glycosylation and to investigate how NP glycosylation could aid NP-based drug discovery. We plan to publish this research in Nat. Prod. Rep.
